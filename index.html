                    <p>I am a 23 year old graduate with a degree in Creative Computing from Bath Spa University. I built several games and applications during my time at univeristy as part of solo and group projects along with a passion project named Street Striker that I have created in the time since then. I primarily used Unity to create these games and as such, I have become very familiar with using the software and the tools within it. This includes coding in C# as it is the scripting language used in Unity allthough I have some experience with using C++ and HTML.

                        <p>Outside of game design, I am a huge football fan as are many around the world, and I enjoy making accessible games related to the sport. My passion project 'Street Striker' is a smartphone game that I developed this year and released on the Apple App Store. It is a 3D level-based, football game where the player has to score goals in a range of different scenarios and while avoiding obstacles. I was inspired to make it when I was looking on the app store for a similar game to play and was unable to find one, so I decided to make one myself, as I thought there may be an audience for this kind of game.

                 <p> Street Striker is a level-based smartphone game available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/street-soccer-striker/id1607150804">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.VoyagerGames.StreetStriker&gl=GB">Google Play Store</a> that I have been developing over the past year. In each level the player aims to shoot the ball into the goal while navigating obstacles and hazards, which take on many shapes and forms that reflect the theme of each level. There are multiple ways for the player to score goals, allowing them the use their imagination to come up with creative solutions for each level. Players set the power, direction and curve of each shot and adjust these values through trial and error until they work out the right combination to score a goal. </p>

                 <p>This was a personal project of mine and therefore the game in its entirety was created and programmed by me, using the Unity Engine and C#; the only exception being some free 3D models and 2D backgrounds. The models that I created for each level were made using basic unity shapes and other Unity tools like cloth meshes to simulate a realistic net etc. Due to the nature of Unity’s bland default skybox, I created my own to make each environment more vibrant and colourful and created metallic materials for all objects that would reflect the new skybox. Some levels have moving objects like cars and animals etc. that I animated within Unity to add a new dynamic to the challenge.</p>

                 <p>I experimented with the physics engine to develop realistic movement for the football, in regard to the amount of spin and power that should be applied to make the goals look impressive but not ridiculous. Through using rigidbodies and adjusting the force on the ball based on the player’s power, direction, and curve selections, I worked out a balance that would be consistent for every level. For this, I wrote an algorithm that would make the angle and power that the ball is kicked at is directly linked to the size and direction of the arrow model and changes as the aiming arrow animation plays. Combining these physics with the level design to create an appropriate level of difficulty took a lot of time investment as I did not want the game to be too easy or hard, so I tested each iteration of the levels out on family and friends to see what changes needed to be made.</p>

                  <p>There is replay mode that I created which allows players to see their goals from new angles and make the goals look more cinematic as they are the main focus of the game. To this end, I used Cinemachine virtual cameras so I could easily make the camera follow the ball whilst keeping the goalposts in view and switch between cameras easily. At first, I used a fixed camera for when players were taking shots, but this was not the best choice as it made depth perception difficult, and players struggled to improve their shots. To enhance the visual quality of the level design I also added some post-processing effects to make the colours more vibrant and the scene brighter.</p>

                  <p>To improve the user experience of the game, I implemented a simple UI that makes shooting and restarting the level a very smooth process as it will be repeated constantly. There is also a level selection screen that gives access to all currently unlocked levels and a loading screen system to manage the unloading of levels and hide the loading process at the start of levels. In terms of audio design, I chose high-quality, non-abrasive sound effects and edited them using Audacity to make them fit for purpose. I chose ambient sounds that would ideally make each level feel quite immersive within themselves as variety within a game is important for retention.</p>

                  <p>Earlier this year, I released this game on the Apple App Store as a free application with Google Mobile Ads implementation in order to monetise the product. As of November 2022, it has amassed 2,000+ downloads with 4,500+ sessions played. I implemented Google AdMob and Firebase plug-ins to get interstitial and banner ads to run within the game in order to monetise it in some way. The game was built using Windows Unity and so I had to transfer the files to X-code and install pod files to upload a version to the App Store with advertising functionality.</p>

                 <p>Garden Pals is an educational smartphone game prototype designed to encourage an interest in garden wildlife. It is a “city-building” game where users are rewarded for taking care of the animals that appear in their virtual garden. The rewards come in the form of in-game currency that can be spent on food and shelters to accommodate new animals. I worked on this game during university as part of a 4-person group project in one of the two programmer roles.</p>

This included working with navigation meshes to create ‘random’ movement and developing a hunger/tiredness system that would create objectives for the player over time. Additionally, I mapped the different animations created by the design team onto the in-game models.</p>

                 <p>Eraser Racer is a 3D multiplayer party game prototype featuring an obstacle course that players race through to get to the finish ahead of the other player/s. The users play as two stickmen who have come to life from a drawing and are racing across objects on desk to escape from a giant eraser. The winner of the race receives 30 points but the catch is that for every death, points are subtracted from each player’s final score. If a player is caught by the eraser they are set to the closest available checkpoint, similarly to how the mechanics in the ‘Trials’ series of video games work.</p>

As with several of my other projects it was developed in Unity. I created a prototype for the level design using Unity ProBuilder to create a course with different types of placeholder obstacles to be replaced by the design team. I then developed the respawning system using checkpoints that would update as they were triggered or destroyed by the eraser and would update the player’s scores. I also created the character controller and had to apply the animations for the player models.</p>

                 <p>‘Kicker’ is a 2D puzzle platforming game that I developed using Construct 3. Within each level the player is given a football that they must carry through the level and score at the end to access the finish. Players must use their platforming skills to avoid the hazards that can kill them and return them to the start of the level, whilst using the ball to hit levers that can open their path. The ball must always be retrieved once it is kicked as it is always necessary to use it to complete the level and it does not respawn.</p>

I aimed to create levels with challenging platforming combined with aiming mechanics that would be easy for users to operate whilst they are running and jumping around. I created a physics system that would replicate how a ball moves in real life during flight but with enough bounce that it would be reasonably possible to return to a place where the player could collect it. I developed the level design using tile-mapping and various 2D sprites that I found online but I created the character using Piskel and gave it animations to fit with my character controller.</p>
